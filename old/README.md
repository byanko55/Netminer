NetFI
==========
`NetFI` is a fast and simple tool to analyze the network flow (internet protocol family). It is a libpcap-based application to parse a network data stream and extract more than 200 kinds of flow-statistical information.

## Description
For anyone who aims to manage and monitor the networked system, it would be a good choice. `NetFI` helps you gain wide visibility in TCP/UDP channels.  Our application is quick enough to handle more than 100,000 packets within a second and so intuitive that the user probably makes familiar use of it easily. `NetFI` captures bidirectional network flows through a given pcap file or even a live network interface, resulting in detailed and diverse statistics about Ethernet, IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP layers. The output stats will be written in a csv file format with columns labeled for each flow, namely source/destination IP:port, flow number, protocol, and hundreds of statistical features (See appendix for all available information). Hopefully, it could be helpful to the expert in various network research fields.


## Installation

#### Build on Linux:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

$ git clone https://github.com/cvlian/NetFI
$ cd NetFI
$ sudo make all
```

## Usage
    
    Usage: netfi [options] ...
    
    Capture packets:
        -i <interface>   : Name of the network interface
        -r <input-file>  : Read packet data from <input-file>
    Capture stop conditions:
        -c <count>       : Set the maximum number of packets to read
        -d <duration>    : Stop after <duration> seconds
    Processing:
        -q               : Print less-verbose flow information
        -s               : Mark a N/A value as '-', instead of a zero value
    Output:
        -w <output-file> : Write all flow-statistical info to <output-file>
                           (or write its results to stdout)
    Others:
        -h               : Displays this help message and exits


#### Network inspection with Pcap File:
    $ sudo netfi -r example.pcap

It will print the session information of corresponding communicating peers.

#### Network inspection on Live Network Interface (and save statistics in example.csv):
    $ sudo netfi -i eth0 -w example.csv
